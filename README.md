# Telegram-Repost-Bot
Tracks images sent in groups on Telegram and calls out reposts

# Dependencies
Requires the `imagehash` and `python-telegram-bot` libraries. The latter should come with the `telegram` library.

# How to Use
- Create a bot by talking to [@Botfather](https://telegram.me/botfather) on Telegram. 
- `config_example.py` allows you to set the token used for your bot 
and also lets you customize the bot's messages when reposts are found or when the `/help` command is used.
Make sure you rename the file to `config.py`!
- Run `repostbot.py` and add your bot to your group!
